        Ahhhh...good ole JS. This loosely typed, dyanmic, multi-paradigm
        language is vital in transforming a web page into a web app. As the only
        language that runs on both client and server-side, there is so much to
        learn and appreciate about this quirky language, and I absolutely love
        it.

        Whether it's a new framework, an update to web security standards, or a
        change in networking protocols, the web ecosystem is constantly
        evolving. I do my best to stay updated with current trends in front end
        technologies and best practices.

        No user, no product. How many times have you tried to navigate through a
        website or web app just to quit and never see it again? At the end of
        the day, the apps we build are services for the everyday user so
        prioritizing UX is paramount.

        Polish, polish, polish...and I'm not talking about the hot
        dogs. I always look forward to refactoring my code to improve performance,
        separate concerns, and modularize; all hallmarks of DRY code.

        Who doesn't enjoy the occasional toy problem? Yes, it is quite the
        struggle until you pass all the tests or smash your face in, but the
        learning involved is invaluable.
