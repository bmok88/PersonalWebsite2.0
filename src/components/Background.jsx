        Brendan here. I'm a detail-oriented software engineer who leverages modern
        technologies to create aesthetic, performant applications that deliver a
        rich UX.

        I discovered my passion for programming mainly through circumstance with a
        healthy injection of curiosity. As a former pre-med undergrad, I know full
        well the struggles and stick-your-face-in-the-book commitments that pepper
        the journey from prospective med school student to MD (major, major props
        to those who have made it). My lack of interest in the medical field and
        sense of urgency in getting my shit together ultimately led me to my first
        few lines of code.

        My primary focus is the front end because I'm naturally a perfectionist
        and I take pride in developing scalable, reusable UI components that
        capture the user's attention through functionality and design. It's damn
        fun writing clean, efficient code that not only optimizes performance, but
        also provides an intuitive, seamless UX. I strive to leave the best first
        impression. Always.

        Currently, I spend my days creating software for LeanTaaS at this thing
        called a job. For me, education never stops. There is so much to learn out
        there, so much information to absorb, and not just in software
        engineering, but in other facets of life as well. Whether it's honing my
        sudoku skills or effortlessly cooking the perfect steak everytime, I am
        always looking to improve myself. If you haven't already, try a growth
        mindset. I hear it's good for you.
