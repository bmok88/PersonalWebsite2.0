    <h5>Welcome To My Corner of The Universe</h5>
    <h4>
      Brendan here. I'm a detail-oriented software engineer who leverages modern
      technologies to create aesthetic, performant applications that deliver a
      rich UX.

      I discovered my passion for programming mainly through circumstance with a
      healthy injection of curiosity. As a former pre-med undergrad, I know full
      well the struggles and stick-your-face-in-the-book commitments that pepper
      the journey from prospective med school student to MD (major, major props
      to those who made it). My lack of interest in medicine and sense of
      urgency in getting my shit together led me to my first few lines of code,
      and the rest is history.

      My primary focus is the front end because I'm naturally a perfectionist
      and I take pride in developing scalable, reusable UI components that
      capture the user's attention through functionality and design. It's damn
      fun writing clean, efficient code that not only optimizes performance, but
      also provides an intuitive, seamless UX. I strive to leave the best first
      impression. Always.

      Currently, I spend my days creating software for LeanTaaS at this thing
      called a job. For me, education never stops. There is so much to learn out
      there, so much information to absorb, and not just in software
      engineering. Whether it's honing my sudoku skills or effortlessly cooking
      the perfect steak everytime, I am always looking to improve myself. If you
      haven't already, try a growth mindset. I heard it's good for you.
