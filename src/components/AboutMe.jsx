      I discovered my passion for programming mainly through circumstance with a
      healthy injection of curiosity. As a former pre-med undergrad, I know full
      well the struggles and stick-your-face-in-the-book commitments that engulf
      the journey from prospective med school student to MD (major, major props
      to those who made it). My lack of interest in medicine and sense of
      urgency in getting my shit together led me to my first few lines of code, and the rest is history.
